.NETGuard SHAREWARE LICENSE
Version 1.0, 26 May 2015

Use of the software

    The shareware products available from XenocodeRCE (France) are governed by 
    this license agreement. By installing the software, or any update to it, 
    you agree to the terms in this document.
    This software program is licensed, not sold. We grant you one license to 
    install and use this software on a single computer at any one time. 
    If you do not agree to the following terms of this license, please uninstall
    and remove all copies and return the product within 30 days of your purchase
    for a full refund.
    You may install and use the software on additional computers, but the 
    software should not be utilized or executed on more than one computer
    simultaneously unless you purchase additional licenses. 
    You may make back-up copies of the software for archival purposes for 
    your personal use only, as protection from disk or computer failure.
    We ask that you not abuse this trust by making copies of either the 
    software or the manual for use by others.
    You may freely distribute copies of the evaluation version of the software,
    in its original format, so long as you do not charge more than a nominal
    fee to cover the cost of materials or distribution. You may not in any way 
    change the original distribution file, except to package it within another 
    archive if necessary. An evaluation version is one distributed by us or by 
    our authorised agents for evaluation purposes and which is described as an 
    evaluation or unlicensed copy in the software's sign-on messages or about box.
    The software is protected by the copyright laws of the European comunity and 
    all other countries. The software and all associated elements such as copyrights, 
    trade names, intellectual property, and information with respect to the software 
    are owned by XenocodeRCE. You may not separately publish, sell, market, 
    distribute, lend, lease, rent, or sublicense the software. However, this license
    is not to be construed as prohibiting or limiting any fair use sanctioned 
    by copyright law, such as permitted library and classroom usage or reverse engineering. 
    Please help us avoid the need for software protection by respecting the major
    investment of time and money that goes into developing quality software for you.
    We will not track or collect any information about your use of the software or
    your data except as you specifically authorize. We will not intentionally deprive 
    you of your ability to use any features of the software or access to your data.
    We will never give or sell to any third party any personal information we collect 
    without your consent, unless required to do so by law. We respect your privacy 
    and will protect it to the same extent we protect our most valuable information.


Limited warranty

    We warrant that the software will provide the features and functions 
    generally described in the product specification on our website when 
    you purchased it and in the product documentation. This warranty will 
    expire 30 days after your purchase. Media on which the software is furnished, 
    if any, will be free from defects in materials and workmanship. 
    This warranty is void if any software failure results from abuse, accident, 
    or misapplication.
    We do not warrant that the software or your ability to use it will be 
    uninterrupted or error-free. We have taken all reasonable steps to keep 
    the software free of viruses, spyware, "back door" entrances, or any other 
    harmful code. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim any
    implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
    We warrant to you that, to the best of our knowledge, the digital data 
    comprising the software do not infringe the rights, including copyrights, 
    trade names, and intellectual property, of any third party.


Limitations on liability

    Your exclusive remedy under the above limited warranty shall be, 
    at our option, either a full refund of the purchase price or correction of 
    the defective software or media. We may choose not to fix bugs in, revise, 
    or update product versions we no longer sell.
    Common sense dictates that any software program be thoroughly tested with 
    non-critical data before relying on it. While every precaution was taken 
    to produce bug free code, you use this software at your own risk. 
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all liability 
    for indirect or consequential damages that arise under this license agreement 
    while using or mis-using this software (including damages, loss of business 
    profits, loss of business information, data loss, or other pecuniary losses).
    We pledge that we will never make available any software that has known defects
    that may result in damage of data residing on the system.


General provisions

    This agreement will be governed by the laws of the European comunity.
    If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, 
    the remaining terms will stay in effect. This agreement does not prejudice 
    the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer.
    This agreement does not supersede any express warranties we made to you. 
    Any modification to this agreement must be agreed to in writing by both parties.
    We periodically release free updates of our software and make these updates 
    available via web download. We recommend that you keep your installation up-to-date. 
    We may require the latest update for a particular product to be installed to 
    process certain support requests.
    These are our current policies. We are free to change these at any time by 
    posting changes to our web site. The new policies will become effective 
    once you obtain an update or download of the software.
    This license agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate 
    it at any time. We reserve the right to terminate this license agreement 
    at any time if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this license agreement. 
    In such event, you agree to destroy the software covered by this agreement, 
    including all copies, functionally-equivalent derivatives, all support files 
    generated by or associated with the software, and all portions and modifications 
    thereof in any form.
